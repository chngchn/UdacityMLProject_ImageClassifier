### Project: Image Classifier

#### Background
This is an Udacity project to implement an image classification application. This app will train a deep learning model on a dataset of images, then use the trained model to classify images.

First, I developed my code in a Jupyter Notebook to ensure my training implementation works. Then, I converted the code to a Python application that runs from the command line.

#### List of files
- Project_Image_Classifier_Project.html: this is the html file used for the project submission.
- 1647503900.h5: this is the trained and saved Keras model.
- Project_Image_Classifier_Project.ipynb: this is the Jupyter Notebook where I developed my code to ensure my training implementation works.
- label_map.json: this is the mapping file provided for the images.
- predict.py: this is the image classifier application that runs from the command line.
- workspace.utils: an utility file provided by the Udacity team.
